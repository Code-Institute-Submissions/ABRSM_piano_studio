# Validator testing 

## HTML 

There were no errors found on HTML. A few warnings were left in but this was a design choice. Specifically the lesson content page needed multiple h1 headings.

## Unfixed bugs 
To my knowledge, everything works as it should. The next and previous buttons, small screen width nav bar, and logo do not move so smoothly in dev tools as you make the screen width lower and lower - I had to do this through lots of media queries - In any case, I intend to maintain the site in the future after it has been assessed with any new skills I gain.
