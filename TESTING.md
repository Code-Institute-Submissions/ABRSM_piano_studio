There were no errors found on HTML. A few warnings were left in but this was a design choice. Specifically the lesson content page needed multiple h1 headings.

# Responsivness
I included a lot of media queries to handle responsivness at all screen widths and can not find any major issues. The main break point is at 900px and most layout changes will happen here.

Videos of each page being tested for responsivness:
- [Home Page](https://youtu.be/_Oz8P8lBNGQ)
- [Lesson Landing Page](https://youtu.be/k1Jt58bt__k)
- [Lesson Page](https://youtu.be/kexqcdu05E8)
- [About Page](https://youtu.be/ROMKPScvxoU)
## Home page
At desktop view the Nav bar is set to the right, the logo to the left, at lower screen width these will be centered and links spaced evenly. The hero image takes up the width of the screen and becomes static at lower screen width and changes shape to a circle for phone view width. 

The welcome text is centered and responsive changing size at smaller screen widths. 

The 3 boxes are wrapped in a flex container. They are relatively positioned to get the effect of the middle box being raised on top of the two. At 900px breakpoint this effect will change to 3 rectangles simply positioned on top of each other. 

## Landing Page

The same consistant color scheme is found her for the boxes also. They are in a flex container and fully responsive. At lower screen widths they take on the style applied to the home page boxes. 3 rectangles stacked on top of each other. 

## Lesson Page

BUG: The directory folder nav link ends up in the header and I was not able to lower this without causing too many major responsivness issues. I left it with a bit of bottom margin to make it look as if it is in the header instead which I am happy with. 

The left side nav bar will not display at lower screen widths. 

The lesson content scroll box will dissapear and lesson will fill length of page at the same breakpoint as side nav bar dissapearing. 

## About 

The about page is fully responsive. It is mostly centered text and was easy to make responsive. The picture is also centered and responsive. 

# Browser Compatibility

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=FHFK&gclid=CjwKCAjw092IBhAwEiwAxR1lRnrDJkW2rc2m-_DsqG2ISAAChH0tbKgopfm-3BMuide3ikPssZgvWhoCsVUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
returned no bugs and responsivness was very good. 

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) had no issues and the only difference I could find was in the subscribe box on the home page. The border radius looks more pronounced and rougher here. 

[Opera](www.opera.com) The only issue I can find in opera is at 300px screen width the logo will briefly overlap the nav menu. It will fix again aroun 290px

[Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) The only difference I can find here is that PDF does not open in new tab but instead in its own window which I do not think is very good for the user experience.

# Bugs 

- Clickable whitespace to the right hand side of piano nav bar.
  - This was the hardest bug to fix as I could not find a solution online. I added display relative without any values to the div containing the first key and it solved the issue. I stumbled upon this fix by accident and have no idea why it worked. 

- White space to the right hand side of page. 
  - A post on stack overflow told me to add overflow hidden to the html body. 

- Uneven boxes 
  - I learnt about flexbox and when I implimented it into the site it became much more responsive and divs were all aligned evenly.
