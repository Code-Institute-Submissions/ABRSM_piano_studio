# Testing 

The hardest thing to get working on this site was the boxes and piano navbar. It was very difficult to have everything centered and responsive. I discovered flexbox and it helped with this. Also having different layouts for the site on mobile and tablet was a lot of extra work but helped keep the site consistently smooth and responsive. 

I had to include a lot of media queries to get the site responsive enough but I feel it was worth the effort. 

The piano nav bar had a bug that was very difficult to fix. the whitespace to the right of it was clickable and wouldn't click back to the home page. I managed to fix this by making the home button position relative even though I didn't move it. 

There was also a lot of whitespace leftover on the right-hand side of the website. I dealt with this by hiding the overflow. It made positioning other elements at lower screen widths very tedious and difficult but it was worth the effort as the site is very responsive now. 

The site was tested on Google Chrome - Mozilla Firefox - Safari - Opera - All without issue.

## Unfixed bugs 
To my knowledge, everything works as it should. The next and previous buttons, small screen width nav bar, and logo do not move so smoothly in dev tools as you make the screen width lower and lower - I had to do this through lots of media queries - In any case, I intend to maintain the site in the future after it has been assessed with any new skills I gain.
