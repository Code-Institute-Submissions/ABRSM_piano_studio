# ABRSM Piano Studio

This site is for piano students preparing for ABRSM exams. The ABRSM is an awarding body that holds graded music exams for many instruments. Every year over 600000 students sit these exams and over 120000 of these are piano students. 

Students are required to prepare 3 pieces on piano for their exam. This website deals with this requirement.

Piano students can use this site to watch a profesional musician play the pieces. See correct fingerings and get access to helpful tips and pdfs of the lessons for free. 

The site is aimed at all ages. Children and teenagers make up a lot of ABRSM students so I tried to keep text to a minimum when in order to keep the site uncluttered and keep navigating the website easy.

The site deals with the practical requirment that students must prepare 3 pieces. It is worth 60% of the exam. In terms of an MVP to launch the site I determined the site need at least 3 songs in one of the grades to actually be useful. 

It is a living breathing site as to update the site with at least 3 videos a week would take almost a year. I am happy the structure of the lesson page is ready so the site owner can continue to update the site by themselves.

# Features

## Existing Features

 Nav Bar 
- In keeping with the theme of the website the nav bar is in the style of a piano. Each white key is a fully functional navigation link. It is the same on each page and will allow users to easily navigate throughout the site. It links to the home page, lesson landing page and the about page.

At smaller screenwidths, the piano makes the nav bar look to cluttered, and so a new smaller, sleeker nav bar will appear in its place to compensate for this. It is also fully functional and provides the same links. It is the same on each page.

Home page image 

- The home page hero image has a great animation that I feel shows the philosophy of the website very well. It will begin on the piano and gradually move to the right to focus on the student. I did not like this effect so much at smaller screen widths, and so on mobile devices the image is static.

Site philosophy and ethos section
- This section of the home page uses 3 boxes to convey basic themes of the website. The center box is a dark pink taken from the hero image. The young girls pink top. I put this color into adobe color wheeel and selected triad to get another 2 complimentary colors. The left is a blue and the right is a green.
- The information in the left box links to the about section. The right box links to the lesson landing page. The center box lets the user subscribe for notifications on future lessons. 
- The 3 boxes aim to reinforce the idea that the content is free and regular. It also allows the user to navigate without scrolling back up. They are responsive.

Footer
- The footer section is very straightforward and includes linkes to youtube, facebook and twitter. It aims to give the teacher on the website more exposure on the internet.

Lesson Landing Page
- information is provided for those students in the event they dont know about the structure of the exam. It is a link to the about section. I found this the best way to keep as much of the website clutter free from too much text for younger users. It also gives anothe opportunity to subscribe by linking back to the box on the home page.
- 3 boxes with the same colors already seen on the homepage with links to the grade and specific song list to make navigating to the page the student needs easier and as painless as possible. There is a hover shadow effect on these boxes also. For color consistancy I added 2 yet to be published lessons. In the future it would be a good idea to keep this consistant by having boxes that say coming soon, it also reinforces the idea that content is regular, the site is living, and that students should subscribe.

Lesson page side nav bar & directory folder 
- The sidebar gives a good layoutand acces to any lesson the user wishes to navigate too. The directory also tells the user exactly where they are, this also links back to the lesson landing page. Very useful for smaller screen width when the side nav bar will not be displayed.

Lesson main content
- The layout will be the same on all future lessons. There is information about the composer, then a video of the piece, underneath there are examples and exercises to practice, finally a link to an external pdf. It has its own scrollbar to keep the content the same length as the sidebar.

Next & Previous buttons 
- simple responsive buttons meant to make navigation easier especially at smaller screen width when lesson side bar is gone. Also keeps coloring consistent. 
<img src="assets/images/next-pre.png">
About page
- The about page is very simple and has the bulk of text on the website. It is meant to give a friendly introduction to the teacher with profile pic and info. It is also a brief summary of exam requirements and an external link to the official website of ABRSM. The language is kept as simple as possible in case kids want to read it but it is primarily meant for adults, especially parents.

Features left to impliment 

- livestream page. It is a good way to keep content relavent on the site but is too much work when the core video lessons are not completed. To record every song at a minimum of 3 a week would take most of the year. 
- interactive nav bar. I would like to have burger icons and nav bars that can expand when needed to be used but I dont have the skills for this yet. This would make the lesson page much easier to navigate although I feel I have done a good job at making it accesible for the time being. When content grows this would be essential. 
- video exchange and sign ins. This would be a great way for students to interact with the teacher. Upload their own videos and get a reply from the teacher. It is just not feasable at the moment because I dont know how to make a site that students can log into and ahve access to, let alone upload videos. 

# Wireframes

I am very happy that most of what I had in mind for the wireframes came to fruition. The advice from my mentor Precious was my sign up page was actually a subscribe feature and that I should move it to the home page. I also only needed an email input for that. I feel this change really hekped the site and made the idea I had for the 3 boxes on the homepage even more impactful. 

The old sign up page became an about section which I think is also very important for the website as it allowed me to keep the rest of the site clutter free from text which I think will help younger users navigate the site a lot easier. 

Here are links to the wireframes:

# Testing 

The hardest thing to get working on this site was the boxes and piano nav bar. It was very difficult to have everything centered and responsive. I discovered flex box and it really helped with this. Also having different layouts for the site on mobile and tablet was a lot of extra work but really helped keep the site consistantly smooth and responsive. 

I had to include a lot of media queries to get the site responsive enough but i feel it was worth the effort. 

The piano nav bar had a bug that was very difficult to fix. basically the whitespace to the right of it was clickable and would't click back to the home page. I managed to fix this by making the home button position relative even though I didn't move it. 

There was also a lot of whitespace left over on the right hand side of the website. I dealt with this by hiding the over flow. It made positioning other elements at lower screen widths very tedious and difficult but it was worth the effort as the site is very responsive now. 

The site was tested on Google Chrome - Mozilla Firefox - Safari - Opera - All without issue.
